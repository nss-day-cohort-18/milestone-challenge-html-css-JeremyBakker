                <h6>by Bren&#233; Brown</h6>
                <p>"I was riveted by a statement from one of my research professors, 'If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.'"</p>
                <p>"Spirituality emerged as a fundamental guidepost in Wholeheartedness. Not religiosity but the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to one another by a force greater than ourselves—a force grounded in love and compassion. For some of us that's God, for others it's nature, art, or even human soulfulness. I believe that owning our worthiness is the act of acknowledging that we are sacred. Perhaps embracing vulnerability and overcoming numbing is ultimately about the care and feeding of our spirits."</p>

                <p>"How do you innovate? FIrst, try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal trouble. I hold—it is beyond speculation, rather a conviction—that innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity."

                <h6>by Ed Catmull</h6>
                <p>"We need to think about failure differently. I’m not the first to say that failure, when approached properly, can be an opportunity for growth. But the way most people interpret this assertion is that mistakes are a necessary evil. Mistakes aren’t a necessary evil. They aren’t evil at all. They are an inevitable consequence of doing something new."</p>

                <h6>by Charles Duhigg</h6>
                <p>"The creative process is, in fact, a process, something that can be broken down and explained. That's important, because it means that anyone can become more creative; we can all become innovation brokers. We all have experiences and tools, disturbances and tensions that can make us into brokers—if, that is, we're willing to embrace that desperation and upheaval and try to see our old ideas in new ways."</p>

                <h6>by Frank Rogers Jr.</h6>
                <p>"Practicing compassion reconnects us to the sources of compassion that resuscitate and sustain the pulse of our spirits. It calms the difficult emotions, drives, and self-talk that tyrannize our interior worlds and transforms them into grounded, free, and empowered self-compassion. It restores our capacities for genuine compassion toward our loved ones, friends, and allies but also, more radically, toward our opponents, our enemies, people who trigger us, and people who threaten us. Lastly, practicing compassion discerns wise and restorative actions that care for the suffering, protect the vulnerable, and preserve the dignity of ourselves and others."</p>
